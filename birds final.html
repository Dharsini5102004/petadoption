It’s recommended to keep cockatiels in pairs so they do not get lonely when you have to leave the home; single cockatiels can be kept as pets, but they require near-constant attention from their owner to stay in high spirits.')">

        <p>To address the welfare of stray animals in the city of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. This we do through animal birth control and anti-rabies drives, and by rescuing animals that are in urgent need of treatment. The rescued animals are treated and rehabilitated at our ABC and Rescue Centre before being released back to their community. The HAS Sanctuary becomes the new home of the ones for whom release wouldn't be safe.</p>
        <p>The Annual Report 2022-2023 is a detailed account of our accomplishments during the year. Shared through descriptive text and vivid images, the publication highlights the tireless efforts of our management team, staff members, donors, volunteers, and well-wishers in creating a more compassionate world for the street animals of Coimbatore.</p>

        <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="round"><br>
        <p><b>1. What are the various modes of payment accepted?</b></p>
        <p>You can make payment via Gpay, PhonePay, Paytm, UPI, Net Banking.</p>
        <p><b>2. What are its hours of operation?</b></p>
        <p>Sunday-Saturday (9.00 A.M - 6.00 P.M)</p>
        <p><b>3. Do I need to come to the centre to choose or pick up my pet?</b></p>
        <p>We strongly encourage you to come to our rehab centre, spend some time with the inmates and choose the right pet for yourself and take them home. However, in scenarios where you can’t, our adoption team will help you with the process.</p>
        <p><b>4. Are the animals house-trained?</b></p>
        <p>Most of the animals at AMTM are rescued stray animals who have spent their lives outdoors. However, once at our centre, we try to train them to live indoors. They are familiarised with people and made to feel comfortable in their company. Additionally, all AMTM animals are sterilized and fully vaccinated.</p>
        <p><b>5. Do you have pedigree animals for adoption?</b></p>
        <p>Yes. AMTM is dedicated to the service of stray and abandoned animals which includes all species. However, this is rare.</p>

        <p>Choosing the right pet:
            Before you decide to adopt, we recommend you consider a few factors:
            <ul>
                <li>Do you have lots of time to entertain an energetic animal or are you looking for an older, calmer pet?</li>
                <li>Do you have an outdoor space that your pet can explore safely? Or would you prefer an animal that's comfortable spending time indoors?</li>
                <li>Do you already have a pet? If yes, what kind of temperament does your existing pet have?</li>
                <li>If you already have a pet, please bring them with you when you come to the shelter. Photos of your help will help us advise you on who from our animal family will be a good fit for you.</li>
